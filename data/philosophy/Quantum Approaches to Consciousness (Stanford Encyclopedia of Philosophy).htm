<div id="preamble">

<p>

It is widely accepted that consciousness or, more generally, mental
activity is in some way correlated to the behavior of the material
brain. Since quantum theory is the most fundamental theory of matter
that is currently available, it is a legitimate question to ask whether
quantum theory can help us to understand consciousness. Several programmatic
approaches answering this question affirmatively, proposed in recent
decades, will be surveyed. It will be pointed out that they make
different epistemological assumptions, refer to different
neurophysiological levels of description, and use quantum theory in
different ways. For each of the approaches discussed, problematic and
promising features will be equally highlighted.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>

The problem of how mind and matter are related to each other has
many facets, and it can be approached from many different starting
points. Of course, the historically leading disciplines in this respect
are philosophy and psychology, which were later joined by behavioral
science, cognitive science and neuroscience. In addition, the physics
of complex systems and quantum physics have played stimulating roles in
the discussion from their beginnings.</p>

<p>

As regards the issue of complexity, this is quite evident: the brain
is one of the most complex systems we know. The study of neural
networks, their relation to the operation of single neurons and other
important topics do and will profit a lot from complex systems
approaches.  As regards quantum physics, there can be no reasonable
doubt that quantum events occur and are efficacious in the brain as
elsewhere in the material world—including biological
systems!<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup> But it
is controversial whether these events are efficacious and relevant for
those aspects of brain activity that are correlated with mental
activity.</p>

<p>

The original motivation in the early 20th century for relating
quantum theory to consciousness was essentially philosophical. It is
fairly plausible that conscious free decisions (“free
will”) are problematic in a perfectly deterministic
 world,<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 so quantum randomness might indeed open up
novel possibilities for free will. (On the other hand, randomness is
problematic for volition!)</p>

<p>

Quantum theory introduced an element of randomness standing out
against the previous deterministic worldview, in which randomness, if
it occurred at all, simply indicated our ignorance of a more detailed
description (as in statistical physics). In sharp contrast to such
epistemic randomness, quantum randomness in processes such as
spontaneous emission of light, radioactive decay, or other examples of
state reduction was considered a fundamental feature of nature,
independent of our ignorance or knowledge. To be precise, this feature
refers to <em>individual</em> quantum events, whereas the behavior of
<em>ensembles</em> of such events is <em>statistically</em> determined.
The indeterminism of individual quantum events is constrained by
statistical laws.</p>

<p>

Other features of quantum theory, which were found attractive in
discussing issues of consciousness, were the concepts of
complementarity and entanglement. Pioneers of quantum physics such as
Planck, Bohr, Schrödinger, Pauli (and others) emphasized the
various possible roles of quantum theory in reconsidering the old
conflict between physical determinism and conscious free will. For
informative overviews with different focal points see e.g., Squires
(1990), Kane (1996), Butterfield (1998), Suarez and Adams (2013).</p>

<p>

In this contribution, some popular approaches for applying quantum
theory to consciousness will be surveyed and compared, most of them speculative,
with varying degrees of elaboration and viability.
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#2">Section 2</a>
 outlines two fundamentally different
philosophical options for conceiving of relations between material and
mental states of systems.
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3">Section 3</a>
 addresses three
different neurophysiological levels of description, to which particular
different quantum approaches refer. After some introductory remarks,
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4">Section 4</a>
 sketches the individual approaches
 themselves—<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.2">Section 4.2</a>:

Hiley, and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.7">Section 4.7</a>:
 purely mental features, mathematically characterized by formal
 structures typical for quantum theory (pioneered by Aerts and colleagues).
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#5">Section 5</a>
 offers some comparative
conclusions.</p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Philosophical Background Assumptions</a></h2>

<p>

Variants of the dichotomy between mind and matter range from their
fundamental distinction at a primordial level of description to the
emergence of mind (consciousness) from the brain as an extremely
sophisticated and highly developed material system. Informative
overviews can be found in Popper and Eccles (1977), Chalmers (1996),
and Pauen (2001).</p>

<p>

One important aspect of all discussions about the relation between
mind and matter is the distinction between <em>descriptive</em> and
<em>explanatory</em> approaches. For instance, <em>correlation</em> is
a descriptive term with empirical relevance, while <em>causation</em>
is an explanatory term associated with theoretical attempts to
understand correlations. Causation implies correlations between cause
and effect, but this does not always apply the other way around:
correlations between two systems can result from a common cause in
their history rather than from a direct causal interaction.</p>

<p>

In the fundamental sciences, one typically speaks of causal
relations in terms of interactions. In physics, for instance, there are
four fundamental kinds of interactions (electromagnetic, weak, strong,
gravitational) which serve to explain the correlations that are
observed in physical systems. As regards the mind-matter problem, the
situation is more difficult. Far from a theoretical understanding in
this field, the existing body of knowledge essentially consists of
empirical correlations between material and mental states. These
correlations are descriptive, not explanatory; they are not causally
conditioned. It is (for some purposes) interesting to know
<em>that</em> particular brain areas are activated during particular
mental activities; but this does, of course, not explain <em>why</em>
they are. Thus, it would be premature to talk about mind-matter
interactions in the sense of causal relations. For the sake of
terminological clarity, the neutral notion of relations between mind
and matter will be used in this article.</p>

<p>

In many approaches used to discuss relations between material [ma]
brain states and mental [me] states of consciousness, these relations
are conceived in a <em>direct</em> way
 <a name="A">(A)</a>:</p>

<blockquote><strong>[ma]
 <img align="top" alt="image 1" src="./Quantum Approaches to Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/img1.jpg">
 [me]</strong></blockquote>

<p>

This provides a minimal framework to study reduction, supervenience,
or emergence relations (Kim 1998; Stephan 1999) which can yield both
monistic and dualistic pictures. For instance, there is the classical
stance of <em>strong reduction</em>, claiming that all mental states
and properties can be reduced to the material domain (materialism) or
even to physics
 (physicalism).<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 This point of view claims that it is both
necessary and sufficient to explore and understand the material domain,
e.g., the brain, in order to understand the mental domain, e.g.,
consciousness. More or less, this leads to a monistic picture, in which any
need to discuss mental states is eliminated right away or at least
considered as epiphenomenal. While mind-brain correlations are still
legitimate though causally inefficacious from an epiphenomenalist point
of view, eliminative materialism renders even correlations
irrelevant.</p>

<p> The most discussed counterarguments against the validity of such
strong reductionist approaches are qualia arguments, which emphasize
the impossibility for materialist accounts to properly incorporate the
quality of the subjective experience of a mental state, the
“what it is like” (Nagel 1974) to be in that state. This
leads to a gap between third-person and first-person accounts for
which Chalmers (1995) has coined the notion of the “hard problem
of consciousness”.  Another, less discussed counterargument is
that the physical domain itself is not causally closed. Any solution
of fundamental equations of motion (be it experimentally, numerically,
or analytically) requires to fix boundary conditions and initial
conditions which are not given by the fundamental laws of nature
(Primas 2002). This causal gap applies to classical physics as well as
quantum physics, where a basic indeterminacy due to collapse make it
even more challenging. A third class of counterarguments refer to the
difficulties to include notions of temporal present and nowness in a
physical description (Franck 2004, 2008).</p>

<p>

However, direct relations between mental and material states can also
be conceived in a non-reductive fashion. A number of variants of
emergence (Stephan 1999) are prominent examples.  Mental states
and/or properties can be considered as emergent if the material brain
is not necessary or not sufficient to explore and understand
 them.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 This leads to a dualistic picture (less radical and more plausible
than Cartesian dualism) in which residua remain if one attempts to
reduce the mental to the material. Within a dualistic scheme of
thinking, it becomes almost inevitable to discuss the question of
causal influence between mental and material states. In particular,
the causal efficacy of mental states upon brain states
(“downward causation”) has recently attracted growing interest (Velmans, 
 2002; Ellis et al. 2011).<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup> 
</p>

<p>

As an alternative to (A), it is possible to conceive mind-matter
relations <em>indirectly</em>
 <a name="B"><strong>(B)</strong></a>,
 via a third category:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr align="center">
<td><strong>[ma]</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>[me]</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="./Quantum Approaches to Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/img2.jpg" alt="image 3"><img src="./Quantum Approaches to Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/img3.jpg" alt="image 3"></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>[mame]</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

This third category, here denoted [mame], is often regarded as being
neutral with respect to the distinction between [ma] and [me], i.e.,
psychophysically neutral. In scenario (B), issues of reduction and
emergence concern the relation between the unseparated “background
reality” [mame] and the distinguished aspects [ma] and [me]. This will
be discussed in more detail in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.6">Section 4.6</a>.</p>

<p>

Such a “dual aspect” option receives increasing attention
in contempory discussions, and it has a long tradition. Early
versions go back as far as Spinoza. In the early days of psychophysics
in the 19th century, Fechner (1861) and Wundt (1911) advocated related
views. Whitehead, the modern pioneer of process philosophy, referred
to mental and physical poles of “actual occasions”, which
themselves transcend their bipolar appearances (Whitehead 1978).  Many
approaches in the tradition of Feigl (1967) and Smart (1963), called
“identity theories”, conceive mental and material states
as essentially identical “central states”, yet considered
from different perspectives. Other variants of this idea have been
suggested by Jung and Pauli (1955) [see also Meier (2001)], involving Jung's
conception of a psychophysically neutral, archetypal order, or by Bohm
and Hiley (Bohm 1990; Bohm &amp; Hiley 1993; Hiley 2001), referring to
an implicate order which unfolds into the different explicate domains
of the mental and the material.</p>

<p> Velmans (2002, 2009) has developed a similar approach, backed up
with empirical material from psychology, and Strawson (2003) has
proposed a “real materialism” which uses a closely related
scheme.  Another proponent of dual aspect thinking is Chalmers (1996),
who considers the possibility that the underlying, psychophysically
neutral level of description could be best characterized in terms of
information.</p>

<p>

Before proceeding further, it should be emphasized that many
present-day approaches prefer to distinguish between first-person and
third-person perspectives rather than mental and material states. This
terminology serves to highlight the discrepancy between immediate
conscious experiences (“qualia”) and their description, be
it behavioral, neural, or biophysical. The notion of the “hard
problem” of consciousness research refers to bridging the gap
between first-person experience and third-person accounts of it. In the
present contribution, mental conscious states are implicitly assumed to
be related to first-person experience. This does not mean, however,
that the problem of how to define consciousness precisely is considered
as resolved. Ultimately, it will be (at least) as difficult to define a
mental state in rigorous terms as it is to define a material state.</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Neurophysiological Levels of Description</a></h2>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Neuronal Assemblies</a></h3>

<p>

A mental system can be in many different conscious, intentional, phenomenal
mental states. In a hypothetical state space, a sequence of such states
forms a trajectory representing what is often called the stream of
consciousness. Since different subsets of the state space are typically
associated with different stability properties, a mental state can be
assumed to be more or less stable, depending on its position in the
state space. Stable states are distinguished by a residence time at that position longer
than that of metastable or unstable states. If a mental state is stable
with respect to perturbations, it “activates” a mental representation
encoding a content that is consciously perceived.</p>

<p>

Moving from this purely psychological, or cognitive, description to
its neurophysiological counterpart leads us to the question: What is
the neural correlate of a mental representation? According to standard
accounts (cf. Noë &amp; Thompson (2004) for discussion),
mental representations are correlated with the activity of neuronal
assemblies, i.e., ensembles of several thousands of coupled
neurons. The neural correlate of a mental representation can be
characterized by the fact that the connectivities, or couplings, among
those neurons form an assembly confined with respect to its
environment, to which connectivities are weaker than within the
assembly. The neural correlate of a mental representation is activated
if the neurons forming the assembly operate more actively, e.g.,
produce higher firing rates, than in their default mode.</p>

<strong>Figure 1: Balance between inhibitory and excitatory connections
among neurons.</strong></blockquote>

<p>

In order to achieve a stable operation of an activated neuronal
assembly, there must be a subtle balance between inhibitory and
excitatory connections among neurons (cf. Figure 1). If the transfer
function of individual neurons is strictly monotonic, i.e., increasing
input leads to increasing output, assemblies are difficult to
stabilize. For this reason, results establishing a
non-monotonic transfer function with a maximal output at intermediate
input are of high significance for the modeling of neuronal assemblies
(Kuhn <em>et al.</em> 2004).  For instance, network models using
lattices of coupled maps with quadratic maximum (Kaneko and Tsuda
2000) are paradigmatic examples of such behavior. These and other
familiar models of neuronal assemblies (for an overview see Anderson
and Rosenfeld 1988) are mostly formulated in a way <em>not</em>
invoking well-defined elements of quantum theory. An explicit
exception is the approach by Umezawa, Vitiello and others (see
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.3">Section 4.3</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Single Neurons and Synapses</a></h3>

<p>

The fact that neuronal assemblies are mostly described in terms of
classical behavior does not rule out that classically undescribable
quantum effects may be significant if one focuses on individual
constituents of assemblies, i.e., single neurons or interfaces between
them. These interfaces, through which the signals between neurons
propagate, are called synapses. There are electrical and chemical
synapses, depending on whether they transmit a signal electrically or
chemically.</p>

<p>

At electrical synapses, the current generated by the action
potential at the presynaptic neuron flows directly into the
postsynaptic cell, which is physically connected to the presynaptic
terminal by a so-called gap junction. At chemical synapses, there is a
cleft between pre- and postsynaptic cell. In order to propagate a
signal, a chemical transmitter (glutamate) is released at the
presynaptic terminal. This release process is called exocytosis. The
transmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors
at the postsynaptic membrane, thus opening an ion channel
(Kandel <em>et al.</em> 2000, part III; see Fig. 2).  Chemical
transmission is slower than electric transmission.</p>

<blockquote><img src="./Quantum Approaches to Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2">
<br>
<strong>Figure 2: Release of neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft
(exocytosis).</strong></blockquote>

<p>

A model developed by Beck and Eccles applies concrete quantum
mechanical features to describe details of the process of exocytosis.
Their model proposes that quantum processes are relevant for exocytosis
and, moreover, are tightly related to states of consciousness. This
will be discussed in more detail in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.4">Section 4.4</a>.</p>

<p>

At this point, another approach developed by Flohr (2000) should be
mentioned, for which chemical synapses with a specific type of
receptors, so-called NMDA
 receptors,<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup>
 are of
paramount significance. Briefly, Flohr observes that the specific
plasticity of NMDA receptors is a necessary condition for the
formation of extended stable neuronal assemblies correlated to
(higher-order) mental representations which he identifies with
conscious states.  Moreover, he indicates a number of mechanisms
caused by anaesthetic agents, which block NMDA receptors and
consequently lead to a loss of consciousness. Flohr's approach is
physicalistic and reductive, and it is entirely independent of any
specific quantum ideas.</p>

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 Microtubuli</a></h3>

<p>

The lowest neurophysiological level, at which quantum processes have
been proposed as a correlate to consciousness, is the level at which
the interior of single neurons is considered: their cytoskeleton. It
consists of protein networks essentially made up of two kinds of
structures, neurofilaments and microtubuli (Fig. 3, left), which are
essential for various transport processes within neurons (as well as
other cells). Microtubuli are long polymers usually constructed of 13
longitudinal α and β-tubulin dimers arranged in a tubular
array with an outside diameter of about 25 nm (Fig. 3, right). For
more details see Kandel <em>et al.</em> (2000), Chap. II.4.</p>

<blockquote><img src="./Quantum Approaches to Consciousness (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/figure3a.jpg" alt="Figure 3a">

 <strong>Figure 3: (left) microtubuli and neurofilaments, the width of
the figure corresponds to approximately 700nm; (right) tubulin dimers,
consisting of α- and β-monomers, constituting a

<p>

The tubulins in microtubuli are the substrate which, in Hameroff's
proposal, is used to embed Penrose's theoretical framework
neurophysiologically. As will be discussed in more detail in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.5">Section 4.5</a>,
 tubulin states are assumed to depend on
quantum events, so that quantum coherence among different tubulins is
possible. Further, a crucial thesis in the scenario of Penrose and
Hameroff is that the (gravitation-induced) collapse of such coherent
tubulin states corresponds to elementary acts of consciousness.</p>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 Ways to Use Quantum Theory</a></h3>

<p>

In the following, (some of) the better known and partly worked out
approaches that use concepts of quantum theory for inquiries into the
nature of consciousness will be presented and discussed. For this
purpose, the philosophical distinctions A/B
 (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#2">Section 2</a>)
 and the neurophysiological distinctions addressed in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3">Section 3</a>
 will serve as guidelines to classify the
respective quantum approaches in a systematic way. However, some
preliminary qualifications concerning different ways to use
quantum theory are in order.</p>

<p>

There are quite a number of accounts discussing quantum theory in
relation to consciousness that adopt basic ideas of quantum theory in a
purely <em>metaphorical</em> manner. Quantum theoretical terms such as
entanglement, superposition, collapse, complementarity, and others are
used without specific reference to how they are defined precisely and
how they are applicable to specific situations. For instance, conscious
acts are just <em>postulated</em> to be interpretable somehow
analogously to physical acts of measurement, or correlations in
psychological systems are just <em>postulated</em> to be interpretable
somehow analogously to physical entanglement. Such accounts may provide
fascinating science fiction, and they may even be important to inspire
nuclei of ideas to be worked out in detail. But unless such detailed
work leads beyond vague metaphors and analogies, they do not yet
represent scientific progress. Approaches falling into this category
will not be discussed in this contribution.</p>

<p>

A second category includes approaches that use the <em>status quo</em>
of present-day quantum theory to describe neurophysiological and/or
neuropsychological processes. Among these approaches, the one with the
longest history was initiated by von Neumann in the 1930s, later taken
up by Wigner, and currently championed by Stapp. It can be roughly
characterized as the proposal to consider intentional conscious acts
as intrinsically correlated with physical state reductions. Another
fairly early idea dating back to Ricciardi and Umezawa in the 1960s is
to treat mental states, particularly memory states, in terms of vacuum
states of quantum fields. A prominent proponent of this approach at
present is Vitiello. Finally, there is the idea suggested by Beck and
Eccles in the 1990s, according to which quantum mechanical processes, relevant
for the description of exocytosis at the synaptic cleft, can be influenced by mental intentions.</p>

<p>

The third category refers to <em>further developments or
generalizations</em> of present-day quantum theory. An obvious
candidate in this respect is the proposal by Penrose to relate
elementary conscious acts to gravitation-induced reductions of quantum
states. Ultimately, this requires the framework of a future theory of
quantum gravity which is far from having been developed. Together with
Penrose, Hameroff has argued that microtubuli might be the right place
to look for such state reductions. Another set of approaches is based
on generalizations of quantum theory beyond quantum <em>physics</em>
proper. In this way, formally generalized concepts such as
complementarity and entanglement can be applied to phenomena in both
mental and material domains. In particular, relations between the two
can be conceived in terms of dual aspects of one underlying
“reality”. This conception, drawing on the philosophy of
Spinoza, has been considered attractive by 20th century scientists
such as Bohr, Pauli, Bohm, Primas, d'Espagnat, and others.  Finally,
there are generalized quantum approaches addressing purely mental
(psychological) phenomena using formal features also employed in
quantum theory, such as non-commuting operations or non-Boolean logic,
but without involving the full-fledged framework of quantum mechanics
or quantum field theory. Some of the applications proposed, e.g., by
the groups of Aerts, Atmanspacher, Bruza, Busemeyer, Khrennikov and
others will be sketched.</p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Stapp: Quantum State Reductions and Conscious Acts</a></h3>

<p>

The act or process of measurement is a crucial aspect in the framework
of quantum theory, that has been the subject of controversy for more
than seven decades now. In his monograph on the mathematical
foundations of quantum mechanics, von Neumann (1955, Chap. V.1)
introduced, in an <em>ad hoc</em> manner, the projection postulate as
a mathematical tool for describing measurement in terms of a
discontinuous, non-causal, instantaneous and irreversible act given by
(1) the transition of a quantum state to an eigenstate
<em>b<sub>j</sub></em> of the measured observable <em>B</em> (with a
certain probability). This transition is often called the
<em>collapse</em> or <em>reduction</em> of the wavefunction, as
opposed to (2) the continuous, unitary (reversible) evolution of a
system according to the Schrödinger equation.</p>

<p>

In Chapter VI, von Neumann (1955) discussed the conceptual distinction
between observed and observing system. In this context, he applied (1)
and (2) to the general situation of a measured object system (I), a
measuring instrument (II), and (the brain of) a human observer
(III). His conclusion was that it makes no difference for the result
of measurements on (I) whether the boundary between observed and
observing system is posited between I and (II &amp; III) or between (I
&amp; II) and III. As a consequence, it is inessential whether a
detector or the human brain is ultimately referred to as the
 “observer”.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

By contrast to von Neumann's fairly cautious stance, London and Bauer
(1939) went much further and proposed that it is indeed human
<em>consciousness</em> which completes quantum measurement (see Jammer
(1974, Sec. 11.3 or Shimony (1963) for a detailed account). In this
way, they attributed a crucial role to consciousness in understanding
quantum measurement—a truly radical position. In the 1960s,
Wigner (1967) followed up on this
 proposal,<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup>
 coining his
now proverbial example of “Wigner's friend”. In order to
describe measurement as a real dynamical process generating
irreversible facts, Wigner called for some nonlinear modification of
(2) to replace von Neumann's projection
 (1).<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Since the 1980s, Stapp has developed his own point of view on the
background of von Neumann and Wigner. In particular, he tries to
understand specific features of consciousness in relation to quantum
theory.  Inspired by von Neumann, Stapp uses the freedom to place the
interface between observed and observing system and locates it in the
observer's brain. He does not suggest any formal modifications to present-day
quantum theory (in particular, he stays essentially within the 
“orthodox”
Hilbert space representation), but adds major interpretational extensions, in
particular with respect to a detailed ontological framework.</p>

<p>

In his earlier work, Stapp (1993)  starts with
Heisenberg's distinction between the potential and the actual
 (Heisenberg 1958), implementing a decisive step beyond the
operational Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg's
notion of the <em>actual</em> is related to a measured event in the
sense of the Copenhagen interpretation. However, Heisenberg's notion of
the <em>potential</em>, of a <em>tendency</em>, relates to the situation
<em>before</em> measurement, which expresses the idea of a reality
independent of
 measurement.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Immediately after its actualization, each event holds the tendency for
the impending actualization of another, subsequent actual
event. Therefore, events are by definition ambiguous. With respect to
their actualized aspect, Stapp's essential move is to “attach to
each Heisenberg actual event an experiential aspect.  The latter is
called the <em>feel</em> of this event, and it can be considered to be
the aspect of the actual event that gives it its status as an
intrinsic actuality” (Stapp 1993, p. 149). </p>

<p>

With respect to their tendency aspect, it is
tempting to understand events in terms of
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#B">scheme (B)</a>
 of Sec. 2.  This is related to Whitehead's ontology, in which mental
and physical poles of so-called “actual occasions” are
considered as psychological and physical aspects of reality.  The
potential antecedents of actual occasions are psychophysically neutral
and refer to a a mode of existence at which mind and matter are
unseparated. This is expressed, for instance, by Stapp's notion of a
“hybrid ontology” with “both idea-like and
matter-like qualities” and “two complementary modes of
evolution” (Stapp 1999, 159). Similarities with a dual aspect
approach (B) (cf. Section 4.6) can clearly be recognized.</p>

<p>

In an interview of 2006, Stapp (2006) specifies some ontological
features of his approach with respect to Whitehead's process thinking,
where actual occasions rather than matter or mind are fundamental
elements of reality. They are conceived as based on a processual
rather than a substantial ontology (see the entry on 
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/">process philosophy</a>). 
 Stapp relates the fundamentally processual nature of
actual occasions to both the physical act of state reduction and the
correlated psychological intentional act.</p>

<p> Another significant aspect of his approach is the possibility that
“conscious intentions of a human being can influence the
activities of his brain” (Stapp 1999, 153).  Different from the
possibly misleading notion of a direct interaction, suggesting an
interpretation in terms of scheme (A) of Sec. 2, he describes this
feature in a more subtle manner. The requirement that the mental and
material outcomes of an actual occasion must match, i.e. be
correlated, acts as a constraint on the way in which these outcomes
are formed within the actual occasion (cf. Stapp 2006).  The notion of
interaction is thus replaced by the notion of a constraint set by
mind-matter correlations (see also Stapp 2007).</p>

<p>

At a level at which conscious mental states and material brain states
are distinguished, each conscious experience, according to Stapp
(1999, p. 153), has as its physical counterpart a quantum state
reduction actualizing “the pattern of activity that is sometimes
called the neural correlate of that conscious experience”.  More
precisely, this pattern of activity may encode an intention and, thus,
represent a “template for action”.  An intentional
decision for an action, preceding the action itself, is then the key
for anything like free will in this picture.</p>

<p>

As to the quantum aspect of a template for action, Stapp argues that
the mental effort, i.e. attention devoted to such intentional acts can
protract the lifetime of the neuronal assemblies that represent the
templates for action due to quantum Zeno-type effects. Concerning
the neurophysiological implementation of this idea, intentional mental
states are assumed to correspond to reductions of superposition states
of neuronal assemblies.  Additional commentary concerning the concepts
of attention and intention in relation to James' idea of a holistic
stream of consciousness (James 1950) is given in Stapp (1999).</p>

<p>

For further progress, it will be mandatory to develop a coherent
formal framework for this approach and elaborate on concrete
details. For instance, it is not yet worked out precisely how quantum
superpositions and their collapses are supposed to occur in neural
correlates of conscious events. Some indications are outlined by 
Schwartz et al. (2005). With these desiderata for
future work, the overall conception is conservative insofar as the
physical formalism remains unchanged.</p> 

<p>This is why Stapp insisted for years that his approach does not
change what he calls “orthodox” quantum mechanics, which
is essentially encoded in the statistical formulation by von Neumann
(1955). From the point of view of standard present-day quantum
physics, however, it is certainly unorthodox to include the mental
state of observers in the theory. Although it is true that quantum
measurement is not yet finally understood in terms of physical theory,
introducing mental states as the essential missing link is highly
speculative from a contemporary perspective.</p>

<p>This link is a radical conceptual move. In what Stapp now denotes
as a “semi-orthodox” approach (Stapp 2015), he proposes
that the blind-chance kind of randomness of individual quantum events
(“nature's choices”) be reconceived as “not actually
random but positively or negatively biased by the positive or negative
values in the minds of the observers that are actualized by its
(nature's) choices” (p. 187). This hypothesis leads into mental
influences on quantum physical processes which are widely unknown
territory at present.

<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 From Umezawa to Vitiello: Quantum Field Theory of Brain States</a></h3>

<p>

In the 1960s, Ricciardi and Umezawa (1967) suggested to utilize the
formalism of quantum field theory to describe brain states, with
particular emphasis on memory. The basic idea is to conceive of memory
states in terms of states of many-particle systems, as inequivalent
representations of vacuum states of quantum
 fields.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 This proposal has gone through several refinements (e.g., Stuart
<em>et al.</em> 1978, 1979; Jibu and Yasue 1995).  Major recent
progress has been achieved by including effects of dissipation, chaos,
fractals and quantum noise (Vitiello 1995; Pessa and Vitiello 2003; Vitiello 2012). For
readable nontechnical accounts of the approach in its present form, embedded 
in quantum field theory as of today,  see Vitiello (2001, 2002).</p>

<p>

Quantum field theory (see the entry 
 on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-field-theory/">quantum field theory</a>) 
 yields infinitely many representations of the canonical commutation
relations, which are inequivalent to the Schrödinger
representation of standard quantum mechanics. Such inequivalent
representations can be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking (see
the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/symmetry-breaking/">symmetry and symmetry breaking</a>),
 occurring when the ground state (or the vacuum state) of
a system is not invariant under the full group of transformations
providing the conservation laws for the system. If symmetry breaks
down, collective modes are generated (so-called Nambu-Goldstone boson
modes), which propagate over the system and introduce long-range
correlations in it.</p>

<p>

These correlations are responsible for the emergence of ordered
patterns. Unlike in thermal systems, a large number of bosons can be
condensed in an ordered state in a highly stable fashion. Roughly
speaking, this provides a quantum field theoretical derivation of
ordered states in many-body systems described in terms of statistical
physics.  In the proposal by Umezawa these dynamically ordered states
represent coherent activity in neuronal assemblies.</p>

<p>

The <em>activation</em> of a neuronal assembly is necessary to make
the encoded content consciously accessible. This activation is
considered to be initiated by external stimuli. Unless the assembly is
activated, its content remains unconscious, unaccessed memory.
According to Umezawa, coherent neuronal assemblies correlated to such
memory states are regarded as vacuum states; their activation leads to
excited states and enables a conscious
recollection of the content encoded in the vacuum (ground) state. The
stability of such states and the role of external stimuli have been
investigated in detail by Stuart <em>et al.</em> (1978, 1979).</p>

<p>

A decisive further step in developing the approach has been achieved
by taking <em>dissipation</em> into account. Dissipation is possible
when the interaction of a system with its environment is considered.
Vitiello (1995) describes how the system-environment interaction
causes a doubling of the collective modes of the system in its
environment. This yields infinitely many differently coded vacuum
states, offering the possibility of many memory contents without
overprinting. Moreover, dissipation leads to finite lifetimes of the
vacuum states, thus representing temporally limited rather than
unlimited memory (Alfinito and Vitiello 2000; Alfinito <em>et al.</em>
2001).  Finally, dissipation generates a genuine arrow of time for the
system, and its interaction with the environment induces
entanglement. Pessa and Vitiello (2003) have
addressed additional effects of chaos and quantum noise.</p>

<p>

Umezawa's proposal addresses the brain as a many-particle system as a
whole, where the “particles” are more or less neurons. In
the language of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.1">Section 3.1</a>, this refers to the
level of neuronal assemblies, which correlate <em>directly</em> with
mental activity. Another merit of the quantum field theory approach is
that it avoids the restrictions of standard quantum mechanics in a
formally sound way. Conceptually speaking, many of the pioneering
presentations of the proposal nevertheless confused mental and
material states (and their properties). This has been clarified by
Freeman and Vitiello (2008): the model “describes the brain, not
mental states.”</p>

<p>

For a corresponding description of brain states, Freeman and Vitiello
2006, 2008, 2010) studied neurobiologically relevant observables such
as electric and magnetic field amplitudes and neurotransmitter
concentration. They found evidence for non-equilibrium analogs of
phase transitions (Vitiello 2015) and power-law distributions of
spectral energy densities of electrocorticograms (Freeman and Vitiello
2010, Freeman and Quian Quiroga 2013). All these observables are
classical, so that neurons, glia cells, “and other physiological
units are <em>not</em> quantum objects in the many-body model of
brain” (Freeman and Vitiello 2008). However, Vitiello (2012)
also points out that the emergence of (self-similar, fractal)
power-law distributions in general is intimately related to
dissipative quantum coherent states (see also recent developments of
the Penrose-Hameroff scenario, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.5">Section 4.5</a>).</p>

<p> 

The overall conclusion is that the application of quantum field theory
describes why and how classical behavior emerges at the level of brain
activity considered. The relevant brains states themselves are viewed
as classical states. Similar to a classical thermodynamical
description arising from quantum statistical mechanics, the idea is to
identify different regimes of stable behavior (phases, attractors) and
transitions between them. This way, quantum field theory provides
formal elements from which a standard classical description of brain
activity can be inferred, and this is its main role in the model. </p>




<h3><a name="4.4">4.4 Beck and Eccles: Quantum Mechanics at the Synaptic Cleft</a></h3>

<p>

Probably the most concrete suggestion of how quantum mechanics in its
present-day appearance can play a role in brain processes is due to
Beck and Eccles (1992), later refined by Beck (2001).  It refers to
particular mechanisms of information transfer at the synaptic
cleft. However, ways in which these quantum processes might be
relevant for mental activity, and in which their interactions with
mental states are conceived, remain unclarified to the present
day.</p>

<p>

As presented in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#3.2">Section 3.2</a>,
 the information flow between neurons in chemical synapses is
initiated by the release of transmitters in the presynaptic
terminal. This process is called exocytosis, and it is triggered by an
arriving nerve impulse with some small probability. In order to
describe the trigger mechanism in a statistical way, thermodynamics or
quantum mechanics can be invoked. A look at the corresponding energy
regimes shows (Beck and Eccles 1992) that quantum processes are
distinguishable from thermal processes for energies higher than
10<sup>-2</sup> eV (at room temperature). Assuming a typical length
scale for biological microsites of the order of several nanometers, an
effective mass below 10 electron masses is sufficient to ensure that
quantum processes prevail over thermal processes.</p>

<p>

The upper limit of the time scale of such processes in the quantum
regime is of the order of 10<sup>-12</sup> sec. This is significantly
shorter than the time scale of cellular processes, which is
10<sup>-9</sup> sec and longer. The sensible difference between the two
time scales makes it possible to treat the corresponding processes as
decoupled from one another.</p>

<p>

The detailed trigger mechanism proposed by Beck and Eccles (1992) is
based on the quantum concept of quasi-particles, reflecting the
particle aspect of a collective mode.  Skipping the details of the
picture, the proposed trigger mechanism refers to tunneling processes
of two-state quasi-particles, resulting in state collapses. It yields
a probability of exocytosis in the range between 0 and 0.7, in
agreement with empirical observations. Using a theoretical framework
developed earlier (Marcus 1956; Jortner 1976), the quantum trigger can
be concretely understood in terms of electron transfer between
biomolecules. However, the question remains how the trigger may be relevant
for conscious mental states. There are two aspects to this
question.</p>

<p>

The first one refers to Eccles' intention to utilize quantum
processes in the brain as an entry point for mental causation. The
idea, as indicated in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#1">Section 1</a>,
 is that the fundamentally indeterministic nature of individual
quantum state collapses offers room for the influence of mental powers
on brain states. In the present picture, this is conceived in such a
way that “mental intention (volition) becomes neurally effective
by <em>momentarily increasing the probability of
exocytosis</em>” (Beck and Eccles 1992, 11360). Further
justification of this assumption is not given.</p>

<p>

The second aspect refers to the problem that processes at
<em>single</em> synapses cannot be simply correlated to mental
activity, whose neural correlates are coherent assemblies of neurons.
Most plausibly, <em>prima facie</em> uncorrelated random processes at
individual synapses would result in a stochastic network of neurons
(Hepp 1999).  Although Beck (2001) has indicated possibilities (such
as quantum stochastic resonance) for achieving ordered patterns at the
level of assemblies from fundamentally random synaptic processes, this
remains an unsolved problem.</p>

<p>

With the exception of Eccles' idea of mental causation, the approach
by Beck and Eccles essentially focuses on brain states and brain
dynamics. In his more recent account, Beck (2001, 109f) states
explicitly that “science cannot, by its very nature, present any
answer to […] questions related to the mind”. In this
sense, a strictly biophysical approach may open the door to controlled
speculation about mind-matter relations, but more cannot be
achieved.</p>

<h3><a name="4.5">4.5 Penrose and Hameroff: Quantum Gravity and Microtubuli</a></h3>

<p>

In the scenario developed by Penrose and neurophysiologically
augmented by Hameroff, quantum theory is claimed to be effective for
consciousness, but the way this happens is quite sophisticated. It
is argued that elementary acts of consciousness are non-algorithmic,
i.e., non-computable, and they are neurophysiologically realized as
gravitation-induced reductions of coherent superposition states in
microtubuli.</p>

<p>

Unlike the approaches discussed so far, which are essentially based
on (different features of) <em>status quo</em> quantum theory, the
physical part of the scenario, proposed by Penrose, refers to future
developments of quantum theory for a proper understanding of the
physical process underlying quantum state reduction. The grander
picture is that a full-blown theory of quantum gravity is required to
ultimately understand quantum measurement (see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantum-gravity/">quantum gravity</a>).</p>

<p>

This is a far-reaching assumption, and Penrose does not offer a
concrete solution to this problem. However, he gives a number of
plausibility arguments which clarify his own motivations and have in
fact inspired others to take his ideas seriously. Penrose's rationale
for invoking state reduction is not that the corresponding randomness
offers room for mental causation to become efficacious (although this
is not excluded). His conceptual starting point, at length developed
in two books (Penrose 1989, 1994), is that elementary conscious acts
must be <em>non-algorithmic</em>. Phrased differently, the emergence
of a conscious act is a process which cannot be described
algorithmically, hence cannot be computed. His background in this
respect has a lot to do with the nature of creativity, mathematical
insight, Gödel's incompleteness theorem, and the idea of a
Platonic reality beyond mind and matter.</p>

<p>

In contrast to the unitary time evolution of quantum processes,
Penrose suggests that a valid formulation of quantum state reduction
replacing von Neumann's projection postulate must faithfully describe
an <em>objective physical process</em> that he calls <em>objective
reduction</em>. Since present-day quantum theory does not contain such
a picture, he argues that effects not currently covered by quantum
theory should play a role in state reduction. Ideal candidates for him
are gravitational effects since gravitation is the only fundamental
interaction which is not integrated into quantum theory so far. Rather
than modifying elements of the theory of gravitation (i.e., general
relativity) to achieve such an integration, Penrose discusses the
reverse: that novel features have to be incorporated in quantum theory
for this purpose. In this way, he arrives at the proposal of
<em>gravitation-induced objective state reduction</em>.</p>

<p>

Why is such a version of state reduction non-computable? Initially
one might think of objective state reduction in terms of
a stochastic process, as most current proposals for such mechanisms
indeed do (see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-collapse/">collapse theories</a>).
 This would certainly be indeterministic, but probabilistic and
stochastic processes can be standardly implemented on a computer,
hence they are definitely computable.  Penrose (1994, Secs 7.8 and
7.10) sketches some ideas concerning genuinely non-computable, not
only random, features of quantum gravity. In order for them to become
viable candidates for explaining the non-computability of
gravitation-induced state reduction, a long way still has to be
gone.</p>

<p>

With respect to the neurophysiological implementation of Penrose's
proposal, his collaboration with Hameroff has been crucial. With his
background as an anaesthesiologist, Hameroff suggested to consider
microtubules as an option for where reductions of quantum states can
take place in an effective way, see e.g., Hameroff and Penrose (1996).
The respective quantum states are assumed to be coherent
superpositions of tubulin states, ultimately extending over many
neurons. Their simultaneous gravitation-induced collapse is
interpreted as an individual elementary act of consciousness. The
proposed mechanism by which such superpositions are established
includes a number of involved details that remain to be confirmed or
disproven.</p>

<p>

The idea of focusing on microtubuli is partly motivated by the
argument that special locations are required to ensure that quantum
states can live long enough to become reduced by gravitational
influence rather than by interactions with the warm and wet environment
within the brain. Speculative remarks about how the non-computable
aspects of the expected new physics mentioned above could be
significant in this
 scenario<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
 are given in Penrose (1994, Sec. 7.7).</p>

<p>

Influential criticism of the possibility that quantum states can in
fact survive long enough in the thermal environment of the brain has
been raised by Tegmark (2000).  He estimates the decoherence time of
tubulin superpositions due to interactions in the brain to be less
than 10<sup>-12</sup> sec. Compared to typical time scales of
microtubular processes of the order of milliseconds and more, he
concludes that the lifetime of tubulin superpositions is much too
short to be significant for neurophysiological processes in the
microtubuli. In a response to this criticism, Hagan <em>et al.</em>
(2002) showed that a corrected version of Tegmark's model provides
decoherence times up to 10 to 100 μ sec, and it has been argued
that this can be extended up to the neurophysiologically relevant
range of 10 to 100 msec under particular assumptions of the scenario
by Penrose and Hameroff.</p>

<p>

More recently, a novel idea has entered this debate. Theoretical
studies of interacting spins have shown that entangled states can be
maintained in noisy open quantum systems at high temperature and far
from thermal equilibrium. In these studies the effect of decoherence
is counterbalanced by a simple “recoherence” mechanism
(Hartmann <em>et al.</em> 2006, Li and Paraoanu 2009). This indicates
that, under particular circumstances, entanglement may persist even in
hot and noisy environments such as the brain.</p>

<p>

However, decoherence is just one piece in the debate about the overall
picture suggested by Penrose and Hameroff. From another perspective,
their proposal of microtubules as quantum computing devices has
recently received support from work of Bandyopadhyay's lab at Japan,
showing evidence for vibrational resonances and conductivity features
in microtubules that should be expected if they are macroscopic
quantum systems (Sahu <em>et al.</em> 2013). Bandyopadhyay's results
initiated considerable attention and commentary (see Hameroff and
Penrose 2014). In a well-informed in-depth analysis, Pitkänen
(2014) raised concerns to the effect that the reported results alone
may not be sufficient to confirm the approach proposed by Hameroff and
Penrose with all its ramifications.</p>

<p>

A recent paper by Craddock <em>et al.</em> (2015) discusses in detail
how microtubular processes (rather than, or in addition to, synaptic
processes, see Flohr 2000) may be affected by anesthetics, and may
also be responsible for neurodegenerative memory disorders. As the
correlation between anesthetics and consciousness seems obvious at the
phenomenological level, it is interesting to know the intricate
mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs act on the cytoskeleton of
neuronal
 cells,<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
 and which role quantum mechanics plays in
these mechanisms. Craddock <em>et al.</em> (2015) point out a number
of possible quantum effects (including the power-law behavior
addressed by Vitiello, cf. <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.3">Section 4.3</a>) which can
be investigated using presently available technologies.</p>

<p>

From a philosophical perspective, the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff
has occasionally received outspoken rejection, see e.g., Grush and
Churchland (1995) and the reply by Penrose and Hameroff
(1995). Indeed, their approach collects several top level mysteries,
among them the relation between mind and matter itself, the ultimate
unification of all physical interactions, the origin of mathematical
truth, and the understanding of brain dynamics across hierarchical
levels. Combining such deep and fascinating issues certainly needs
further work to be substantiated, and should neither be too quickly
celebrated nor offhandedly dismissed. After the two decades since its
inception one thing can be safely asserted: the approach has
fruitfully inspired many important avenues of innovative research in
consciousness studies. </p>

<h3><a name="4.6">4.6 Mind and Matter as Dual Aspects</a></h3>

<p>

Dual-aspect approaches consider mental and material domains of
reality as aspects, or manifestations, of one underlying reality in
which mind and matter are unseparated. In such a framework, the
distinction between mind and matter results from the application of a
basic tool for achieving epistemic access to, i.e., gather knowledge
about, both the separated domains and the underlying
 reality.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
Consequently, the status of the underlying, psychophysically neutral
domain is considered as <em>ontic relative to</em> the mind-matter
distinction.</p>

<p>

As mentioned in
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#2">Section 2</a>,
dual-aspect approaches have a long history, essentially starting with
Spinoza as a most outspoken protagonist. Major directions in the 20th
century have been described and compared to some detail by
Atmanspacher (2014). An important distinction between two basic
classes of dual-aspect thinking is the way in which the
psychophysically neutral domain is related to the mental and the
physical. For Russell and the neo-Russellians
the <em>compositional</em> arrangements of psychophysically neutral
elements decide how they differ with respect to mental or physical
properties. As a consequence, the mental and the physical are
reducible to the neutral domain. Chalmers' (1996, Chap. 8) ideas on
“consciousness and information” fall into this
class. Tononi's theoretical framework of “integrated information
theory” (see Oizumi <em>et al.</em> 2014, Tononi and Koch 2015)
can be seen as a concrete implementation of a number of features of
Chalmers' proposal. No quantum structures are involved in this
work.</p>

<p>

The other class of dual-aspect thinking is <em>decompositional</em>
rather than compositional. Here the basic metaphysics of the
psychophysically neutral domain is holistic, and the mental and the
physical (neither reducible to one another nor to the neutral) emerge
by breaking the holistic symmetry or, in other words, by making
distinctions.  This framework is guided by the analogy to quantum
holism, and the predominant versions of this picture are quantum
theoretically inspired as, for instance, proposed by Pauli and Jung
(Jung and Pauli 1955; Meier 2001) and by Bohm and Hiley (Bohm 1990;
Bohm and Hiley 1993; Hiley 2001). They are based on speculations that
clearly exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory. </p>

<p>

In Bohm's and Hiley's approach, the notions of implicate and explicate
order mirror the distinction between ontic and epistemic
domains. Mental and physical states emerge by explication, or
unfoldment, from an ultimately undivided and psychophysically neutral
implicate, enfolded order. This order is called <em>holomovement</em>
because it is not static but rather dynamic, as in Whitehead's process
philosophy. De Gosson and Hiley (2013) give a good introduction of how
the holomovement can be addressed from a formal (algebraic) point of
view.</p>

<p>

At the level of the implicate order, the term <em>active information</em>
expresses that this level is capable of “informing” the
epistemically distinguished, explicate domains of mind and matter. At
this point it should be emphasized that the usual notion of information
is clearly an epistemic term. Nevertheless, there are quite a number of
dual-aspect approaches addressing something like information at the
ontic, psychophysically neutral
 level.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Using an
information-like concept in a non-epistemic manner is inconsistent if
the common (syntactic) significance of Shannon-type information is
intended, which requires distinctions in order to construct partitions,
providing alternatives, in the set of given events. Most
information-based dual-aspect approaches do not sufficiently clarify
their notion of information, so that misunderstandings abound easily.</p>

<p>

While the proposal by Bohm and Hiley essentially sketches a
conceptual framework without further concrete details, particularly concerning
the mental domain, the suggestions by Pauli and Jung offer some more
material to discuss. An intuitively appealing way to represent their
approach considers the distinction between epistemic and ontic domains
of <em>material</em> reality due to quantum theory in parallel with the
distinction between epistemic and ontic <em>mental</em> domains.</p>

<p>

On the physical side, the epistemic/ontic distinction refers to the
distinction between a “local realism” of empirical facts
obtained from classical measuring instruments and a “holistic
realism” of entangled systems (Atmanspacher and Primas 2003).
Essentially, these domains are connected by the process of
measurement, thus far conceived as independent of conscious
observers. The corresponding picture on the mental side refers to a
distinction between the conscious and the
 unconscious.<sup>[<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>
 In Jung's depth psychological conceptions, these two domains are connected
by a process of emergence of conscious mental states from the
unconscious, analogous to physical measurement.</p>

<p>

In Jung's depth psychology it is crucial that the unconscious has a
<em>collective</em> component, unseparated between individuals and
consisting of the so-called <em>archetypes</em>. They are regarded as
constituting the psychophysically neutral level covering both the
collective unconscious and the holistic reality of quantum theory. At
the same time they operate as “ordering factors”, being
responsible for the arrangement of their psychical and physical
manifestations in the epistemically distinguished domains of mind and
matter. More detailed illustrations of this picture can be found in
Jung and Pauli (1955), Meier (2001), Atmanspacher and Primas (2009), 
Atmanspacher and Fach (2013), and Atmanspacher and Fuchs (2014).</p>

<p>

This scheme is clearly related to
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#B">scenario (B)</a>
 of
 (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#2">Sec. 2</a>,
 combining an epistemically dualistic with an
ontically monistic approach. There is a causal relationship (in the
sense of formal rather than efficient causation) between the
psychophysically neutral, monistic level and the epistemically
distinguished mental and material domains. In Pauli's and Jung's terms
this kind of causation is expressed by the ordering operation of
archetypes in the collective unconscious.</p>

<p>

A remarkable feature of
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#B">scenario (B)</a>
 is the possibility that the mental and material manifestations may
inherit mutual correlations due to the fact that they are jointly
caused by the psychophysically neutral level. One might say that such
correlations are remnants reflecting the lost holism on this level. In
this sense, they are <em>not</em> the result of any <em>direct</em>
causal interaction between mental and material domains. Thus, they are
<em>not</em> suitable for an explanation of <em>direct</em> mental
causation in the usual sense. Their existence would require some
unconscious activity entailing correlation effects that would appear
as mental causation. Independently of quantum theory, a related move
was suggested by Velmans (2002, 2009).  But even without mental causation,
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#B">scenario (B)</a>
 is relevant to ubiquitous correlations between conscious mental states and brain
states.</p>

<p>

In the Pauli-Jung conjecture, these correlations are
called <em>synchronistic</em> (see also Primas 1996), and have been
extended to psychosomatic relations (Meier 1975). A more comprehensive
typology of mind-matter correlations following from Pauli's and Jung's
dual-aspect monism was proposed by Atmanspacher and Fach
(2013). They found that a large body of empirical material concerning
so-called “exceptional experiences” can be classified
according to their deviation from the conventional reality model of a
subject and from the conventional relations between its
components. Synchronicities in the sense of Pauli and Jung appear as a
special case of such relational deviations. </p>

<p>

An essential condition required for synchronistic correlations is that
they are <em>meaningful</em> for those who experience them. It is
tempting to interpret the use of meaning as an attempt to introduce
semantic information as an alternative to syntactic information as
addressed above. Although this entails difficult problems concerning a
clear-cut definition and operationalization, something akin to
meaning, both explicitly and implicitly, might be a relevant
informational currency for mind-matter relations within the framework
of decompositional dual-aspect thinking (Atmanspacher 2014).</p>

<p>

Primas (2003, 2009) has proposed a dual-aspect approach where
the distinction of mental and material domains originates from the
distinction between two different modes of time: tensed (mental) time,
including nowness, on the one hand and tenseless (physical) time,
viewed as an external parameter, on the other (see the entries on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/">time</a>
 and on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-bebecome/">being and becoming in modern physics</a>).
Regarding these two concepts of time as implied by a symmetry
breaking of a timeless level of reality that is psychophysically
neutral, Primas conceives the tensed time of the mental domain as
quantum-correlated with the parameter time of physics via
“time-entanglement”. Although this scenario has been
formulated in a Hilbert space framework with appropriate time
operators (Primas 2009), it is still a tentative scheme without
concrete indications of how to test it empirically. Nevertheless it
offers a formally elaborated and conceptually consistent dual-aspect
quantum framework for basic aspects of the mind-matter problem.</p>

<p>

As indicated above, the approaches by Stapp
 (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.2">Section 4.2</a>)
 and Vitiello
 (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.3">Section 4.3</a>)
 contain elements of dual-aspect thinking as well, although these are
not much emphasized by the authors. The dual-aspect quantum approaches
discussed in the present section tend to focus on the issue of
entanglement more than on state reduction. The primary purpose here is
to understand correlations between mental and material domains rather
than direct interactions between them.</p>

<p>

A final issue of dual-aspect approaches in general refers
to the problem of panpsychism or panexperientialism, respectively 
(see the review by Skrbina 2003, and the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/">panpsychism</a>).
 In the limit of a <em>universal</em>
symmetry breaking at the psychophysically neutral level, <em>every</em>
system has both a mental and a material aspect. In such a situation it
is important to understand “mentality” much more generally
than “consciousness”. Unconscious or proto-mental acts as
opposed to conscious mental acts are notions sometimes used to
underline this difference. The special case of human consciousness
within the mental domain as a whole might be regarded as special as its
material correlate, the brain, within the material domain as a
whole.</p>

<h3><a name="4.7">4.7 Mental Quantum Features</a></h3>

<p>

It has been an old idea by Bohr that central conceptual features of
quantum theory, such as complementarity, are also of pivotal
significance outside the domain of physics. In fact, Bohr became
familiar with the idea through the psychologist Edgar Rubin and, more
indirectly, William James (Holton 1970) and immediately saw its
potential for quantum physics. Although Bohr was always convinced of
the extraphysical relevance of complementarity, he never elaborated
this idea in concrete detail, and for a long time after him no one
else did so either. This situation has changed: there are now a number
of research programs generalizing key notions of quantum theory in a
way that makes them applicable beyond physics.  </p>

<p>

Of particular interest are approaches that have been developed in
order to pick up Bohr's proposal with respect to psychology and
cognitive science. The first steps in this direction were made by the
group of Aerts in the early 1990s (Aerts <em>et al.</em> 1993), using
non-distributive propositional lattices to address quantum-like
behavior in non-quantum systems. Alternative approaches have been
initiated by Khrennikov (1999), focusing on non-classical
probabilities, and Atmanspacher <em>et al.</em> (2002), outlining an
algebraic framework with non-commuting operations. Other lines of
thinking are due to Primas (2007), addressing complementarity with
partial Boolean algebras, and Filk and von Müller (2008),
indicating links between basic conceptual categories in quantum
physics and psychology.</p>

<p>

A formal move to incorporate quantum behavior in mental systems,
without referring to quantum brain activity, is based on a state space
description of mental systems. If mental states are defined on the
basis of cells of a neural state space partition, then this partition
needs to be well tailored to lead to robustly defined states. Ad hoc
chosen partitions will generally create incompatible descriptions
(Atmanspacher and beim Graben 2007). This implies that quantum brain
dynamics is not the only possible explanation of quantum features in
mental systems. Assuming that mental states arise from partitions of
neural states in such a way that statistical neural states are
co-extensive with individual mental states, the nature of mental
processes depends strongly on the kind of partition chosen. If the
partition is not properly constructed, it is likely that mental states
and observables show features that resemble quantum behavior although
the correlated brain activity may be entirely classical: quantum mind
without quantum brain.</p>

<p>

Intuitively, it is not difficult to understand why non-commuting
operations or non-Boolean logic should be relevant, even inevitable,
for mental systems that have nothing to do with quantum
physics. Simply speaking, the non-commutativity of operations means
nothing else than that the sequence, in which operations are applied,
matters for the final result. And non-Boolean logic refers to
propositions that may have unsharp truth values beyond yes or no,
shades of plausibility or credibility as it were. Both versions
obviously abound in psychology and cognitive science (and in everyday
life). Pylkkänen (2015) has even suggested to use this intuitive
accessibility of mental quantum features for a better conceptual grasp
of quantum <em>physics</em>.  </p>

<p>

The particular strength of the idea of generalizing quantum theory
beyond quantum physics is that it provides a formal framework which
both yields a transparent well-defined link to conventional quantum
physics and has been used to describe a number of concrete
psychological applications with surprisingly detailed theoretical and
empirical results. Corresponding approaches fall under the third
category of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-consciousness/#4.1">Section 4.1</a>: further developments or
generalizations of quantum theory.</p>

<p>

One rationale for the focus on psychological phenomena is that their
detailed study is a necessary precondition for further questions as to
their neural correlates. Therefore, the investigation of mental
quantum features resists the temptation to reduce them (within
scenario A) all-too quickly to neural activity. There are several
kinds of psychological phenomena which have been addressed in the
spirit of mental quantum features so far: (i) decision processes, (ii)
order effects, (iii) bistable perception, (iv) learning, (v) agency,
(vi) semantic networks, and (vii) super-quantum entanglement
correlations.</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>An early precursor of work on decision processes is due to Aerts
and Aerts (1994). However, the first detailed account appeared in a
comprehensive publication by Busemeyer <em>et al.</em> (2006). The key
idea is to define probabilities for decision outcomes and decision
times in terms of quantum probability amplitudes. Busemeyer <em>et
al.</em> found agreement of a suitable Hilbert space model (and
disagreement of a classical alternative) with empirical
data. Moreover, they were able to clarify the long-standing riddle of
the so-called conjunction and disjunction effects (Tversky and Shafir
1992) in decision making (Pothos and Busemeyer 2009).  Another
application refers to the asymmetry of similarity judgments (Tversky
1977), which can be adequately understood by quantum approaches (see
Aerts <em>et al.</em> 2011, Pothos <em>et al.</em> 2013).</li>

<li>Order effects in polls, surveys, and questionnaires, recognized
for a long time (Schwarz and Sudman 1992), are still insufficiently
understood today. Their study as contextual quantum features (Aerts
and Aerts 1994, Busemeyer <em>et al.</em> 2011) offers the potential
to unveil a lot more about such effects than the well-known fact that
responses can drastically alter if questions are swapped. Atmanspacher
and Römer (2012) proposed a complete classification of possible
order effects (including uncertainty relations, and independent of
Hilbert space representations), and Wang <em>et al.</em> (2014)
discovered a fundamental covariance condition (called the QQ equation)
for a wide class of order effects.</li>

<li>The perception of a stimulus is bistable if the stimulus is
ambiguous, such as the Necker cube. Atmanspacher and colleagues
developed a detailed model predicting a quantitative relation between
basic psychophysical time scales in bistable perception that has been
confirmed experimentally (Atmanspacher and Filk 2013). Moreover,
Atmanspacher and Filk (2010) conjectured that particular distinguished
states in bistable perception may violate temporal Bell
inqualitities—a litmus test for quantum behavior. See also
Mahler (2015) for an informed overview of temporal Bell inequalities
and their consequences. </li>

<li>Another quite obvious arena for non-commutative behavior is
learning behavior. In theoretical studies, Atmanspacher and Filk
(2006) showed that in simple supervised learning tasks small recurrent
networks not only learn the prescribed input-output relation but also
the sequence in which inputs have been presented. This entails that
the recognition of inputs is impaired if the sequence of presentation
is changed. In very few exceptional cases, with special
characteristics that remain to be explored, this impairment is
avoided.</li>

<li>A quantum approach for understanding issues related to agency,
intention, and other controversial topics in the philosophy of mind
has been proposed by Briegel and Müller (2014, in Other Internet
Resources). This proposal is based on work on quantum algorithms for
reinforcement learning in neural networks (“projective
simulation”, Paparo <em>et al.</em> 2012), which can be regarded
as a variant of quantum machine learning (Wittek 2014). The gist of
the idea is how agents can develop agency as a kind of independence
from their environment and the deterministic laws governing it
(Briegel 2012). The behavior of the agent itself is simulated as a
non-deterministic quantum random walk in its memory space.</li>

<li>The difficult issue of meaning in natural languages is often
explored in terms of semantic networks. Gabora and Aerts (2002)
described the way in which concepts are evoked, used, and combined to
generate meaning depending on contexts. Their ideas about concept
association in evolution were further developed by Gabora and Aerts
(2009). Bruza <em>et al.</em> (2009) referred to meaning relations in
terms of entanglement-style features in quantum representations of the
human mental lexicon and propose experimental work capable of testing
this approach. See Bruza <em>et al.</em> (2013, in Other Internet
Resources) for first empirical results in this direction. </li>

<li>Quantum entanglement implies correlations exceeding standard
classical correlations (by violating Bell-type inequalitites) but
obeying the so-called Tsirelson bound. However, this bound does not
exhaust the range by which Bell-type correlations can be violated in
principle. Popescu and Rohrlich (1994) found such correlations for
particular quantum measurements, and Dzhafarov and Kujala (2013)
derived a compact way to distinguish the different types of
correlations theoretically. Super-quantum correlations may arise due
to priming or other context effects in mental systems. Possible
examples are non-separable concept combinations a la Bruza <em>et
al.</em> (2013, in Other Internet Resources).</li>

</ol>

<p>

It is a distinguishing aspect of the approaches listed above that they
have led to well-defined and specific theoretical models with
empirical consequences and novel predictions. A second point worth
mentioning is that the approaches have formed a scientific
community—there are several groups worldwide (rather than
solitary actors) studying quantum ideas in cognition, partly even in
collaborative efforts. For about a decade there have been regular
international conferences with proceedings for the exchange of new
results and ideas, and target articles and special issues of well
established journals have been devoted to basic frameworks and new
developments (Busemeyer and Bruza 2013, Pothos and Busemeyer 2013,
Haven and Khrennikov 2013, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2013), Wendt (2015). </p>
 

<h2><a name="5">5. Conclusions</a></h2>

<p>

The historical motivation for exploring quantum theory in trying to
understand consciousness derived from the realization that
collapse-type quantum events introduce an element of randomness, which
is primary (ontic) rather than merely due to ignorance or missing
information (epistemic). Approaches such as those of Wigner, of Stapp,
and of Beck and Eccles emphasize this (in different ways), insofar as
the ontic randomness of quantum events is regarded to provide room for
mental causation, i.e., the possibility that conscious mental acts can
influence brain behavior. The approach by Penrose and Hameroff also
focuses on state collapse, but with a significant move from mental
causation to the non-computability of (particular) conscious acts.</p>

<p>

Any discussion of state collapse or state reduction (e.g. by
measurement) refers, at least implicitly, to superposition states
since those are the states that are reduced. Insofar as entangled
systems remain in a quantum superposition as long as no measurement
has occurred, entanglement is always co-addressed when state reduction
is discussed. By contrast, some of the dual-aspect quantum approaches
utilize the topic of entanglement differently, and independently of
state reduction in the first place. Inspired by the
entanglement-induced nonlocal correlations of quantum physics,
mind-matter entanglement is conceived as the hypothetical origin of
mind-matter correlations. This reflects the highly speculative picture
of a fundamentally holistic, psychophysically neutral level of reality
from which correlated mental and material domains emerge.</p>

<p>

Each of the examples discussed in this overview has both promising and
problematic aspects. The approach by Beck and Eccles is most detailed
and concrete with respect to the application of standard quantum
mechanics to the process of exocytosis. However, it does not solve the
problem of how the activity of single synapses enters the dynamics of
neural assemblies, and it leaves mental causation of quantum processes
as a mere claim. Stapp's approach suggests a radically expanded
ontological basis for both the mental domain and status-quo quantum
theory as a theory of matter without essentially changing the
formalism of quantum theory.  Although related to inspiring
philosophical and some psychological background, it still lacks
empirical confirmation. The proposal by Penrose and Hameroff exceeds
the domain of present-day quantum theory by far and is the most
speculative example among those discussed. It is not easy to see how
the picture as a whole can be formally worked out and put to empirical
test.</p>

<p>

The approach initiated by Umezawa is embedded in the framework of
quantum field theory, more broadly applicable and formally more
sophisticated than standard quantum mechanics. It is used to describe
the emergence of classical activity in neuronal assemblies on the basis
of symmetry breakings in a quantum field theoretical framework. 
A clear conceptual distinction between brain states and mental states has often 
been missing, but this ambiguity has recently been resolved in favor of brain 
states. Their relation to mental states is ultimately left open; some of 
Vitiello's accounts suggest a vague inclination toward a dual-aspect 
approach.</p> 

<p>

The dual-aspect approaches of Pauli and Jung and of Bohm and Hiley are
conceptually more transparent and more promising. On the other hand,
they are essentially unsatisfactory with regard to a sound formal
basis and concrete empirical scenarios. Hiley's work offers an
algebraic framework which may lead to theoretical progress. A novel
dual-aspect quantum proposal by Primas, based on the distinction
between tensed mental time and tenseless physical time, marks a
significant step forward, particularly as concerns a consistent formal
framework.</p>

<p> 

Maybe the best prognosis for future success among the examples
described in this overview, at least on foreseeable time scales, goes
to the investigation of mental quantum features without focusing on
associated brain activity to begin with. A number of corresponding
approaches have been developed which include concrete models for
concrete situations and have lead to successful empirical tests and
further predictions. On the other hand, a coherent theory behind
individual models and relating the different types of approaches is
still to be settled in detail. With respect to scientific practice, a
particularly promising aspect is the visible formation of a scientific
community with conferences, mutual collaborations, and some
perspicuous attraction for young scientists to join the field. </p>
